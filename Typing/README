Some of the big issues remaining with the typer :

- no dynamic casting between int, float etc ...
5+1.0 will raise an IncoherentTypes error
The typer also does not realize that String and Object.String are the same type, so

void display(String s) { ... }
display("hello")

does not workd, cause "hello" is typed as Object.String

- arrays : more than 1D will probably not be typed correctly

- the environment variable only consider one class at a time, so you can't use the methods and attributes of another class
